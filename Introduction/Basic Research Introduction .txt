Rhythm and Blues (R&B) music uses advanced chord techniques, like extended chords, chord inversions, and borrowed chords. These techniques, along with a strong back beat, give R&B its distinctive sound. 

Chord techniques 

Extended chords: Triads with added notes, such as 7, 9, 11, and 13 chords

Chord inversions: Rearranging the notes in a chord, such as inverting a Cmaj7 chord to E – G – B – C

Borrowed chords: Using chords from another key or mode, such as borrowing chords from the parallel key of D minor
